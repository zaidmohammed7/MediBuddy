## Project Summary

MediBuddy is a personal health assistant web application designed to help users manage their medications and basic healthcare needs. The platform enables users to store prescriptions, receive reminders for medication intake and refills, check for potential drug interactions, and stay connected with emergency contacts in case of non-compliance. In addition, MediBuddy integrates a conversational chatbot that allows users to discuss their symptoms and receive a preliminary health summary along with nearby doctor recommendations.

By combining multiple healthcare datasets and APIs, MediBuddy provides users with a practical, reliable, and intelligent tool to streamline day-to-day health management while ensuring safety and adherence to treatments.
